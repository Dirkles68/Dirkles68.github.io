excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am a father of two boys. I work for a living. I am not a professional. I am just a person. I am working on expanding my skills for the enjoyment of it. 

## Here is a list of my plans over the next few months:

- Website Design / HTML / CSS
- GitHub / [Here is mine so far...](https://dirkles68.github.io/)
- Update and sharpen my now dulled GIS skills
- Python
- SQL / PHP
- Become more familiar with the inner workings of Windows / Linux (Shell and Terminal)
- Get my __double bass pedaling__ back up to snuff
