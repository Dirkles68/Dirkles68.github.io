One this is for sure, even though I am spending about 1.5 hours per night on weekdays working on these wicked website building skills, I feel like time is rushing by, and I am not getting much done. Tonight for example, I spent most of the time just trying to figure out how to get a div to not stick out at the end of the parent div. Eventually, after some masterful googling, I managed to find the solution...

```CSS
* {
  box-sizing:border-box;
}
```

Yep, that was all it took, and it only took me about an hour to figure it out.

Dirkles, out.
