Just a quick post here, an update to what I have been working on the last couple of days. I know it is not much, but I think I have finally started understanding it. Here is a breakdown:

- Relative positioning - sets the element into a position using the offset (top, bottom, left, right) relative to its current position, while keeping the element in the normal flow of the document
- Absolute - sets the element into a position based on its parent container (the parent must be set to relative). If there is no closest positioned parent container, then the position is offset based on the html document (the body). This also removes the element from the normal flow, and other elements ignore it.
-Fixed - set the position based on offset to the html (body) and stays in that position no matter where the page scrolls to

I am going to keep practicing this as I don't want it to slip into knowledge obscurity like other things seem to do.

Dirkles, out.
