I started working on the Product Landing Page, and it is coming along pretty nicely. I have run into a few snags here and there, but for the most part it is pretty good. I am feeling more confident, even though I am still having to google a lot. But I am realizing that that is perfectly normal.

Anyhow, the page is for a boot company called SMITH Boots. It's a cowboy boot.
