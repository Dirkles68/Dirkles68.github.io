I know, I have skipped some days here, and I said in the beginning that I was not going to do that. It is not that I have gotten lazy, but I is difficult some days (nights really) to put something down on this blog. Be it a lack of desire, energy, or even meaningful content, sometimes I just don't have it in me to post something. This is a terrible excuse I know. Once of the main points was to try and cut through the "i'm too tired / unmotivated / have nothing to say / etc" bullshit, and make a genuine habit out of doing this. Now I don't know what day I am supposed to be on, and its bugging me that the days are possibly out of sync with reality.

Now to the fun part. While I have been working on my technical doc page (which I think is going great), my laptop has decided to start kicking out hard drive failure messages. So for the last couple of days I have been working on the website less and less, because I have been focused on saving my computer and backing up windows just in case it shits the bed. It seems pretty stable for now, but just in case, I went ahead and bought a new computer. It should be here by the weekend.

As for the technical doc page, it is still a work in progress.
