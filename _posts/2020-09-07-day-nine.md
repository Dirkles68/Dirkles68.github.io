Not much in terms of lessons was completed today. I did manage to finish the first lesson in HTML from [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). That is all I really did today. I got distracted trying to figure out the best way to host images to practice building a website from scratch. I ended up downloading Dropbox. I will try that later. I really didn't want to move on with lessons until I got some good practice in with the first one. It was pretty easy but requires memorizing different instructions, like:
  -paragraphs
  -links
  -images
  -ordered/unordered lists
  -text entry box (what is this called?)
  -submit button
  -radio buttons and checkboxes.

  I am forgetting the rest which is exactly why I must go back and practice before moving on.

  Good night, Dirkles out.
