You may have noticed that I referred to this blog entry as "Forty Four". Leaving out "Day" in the title was intentional and not an oversight. When I first decided to start writing this blog (for let's face it, nobody but myself) my intention was to log an entry every day. And because it would be written every day, it was only natural to title them as "Day One", "Day Two" etc.. Submitting a post every day however, in this case, just is not practical. For one, I am not a very verbose person. I usually do not feel the need to post anything anywhere about whatever I am doing. So it is already outside of my usual habits to do something like this everyday. Initially, I planned on posting everyday to encourage myself to do the study/work that would be the subject of each post. I reality though, it was not helping. In fact, I was often forcing myself to write something for the sake of writing something, so there are many posts that are just complete wastes of time. From now on, I will only post something when there is actually something to write about. So from here on out, I am no longer including "Day" in the titles, and just assigning them the post number.

Since my last post, I was still working on the technical document and also fixing my newer(old) laptop. It is not running fine, though I did make an oopsie by installing the Windows 10 update on the new SSD while the old (apparently failing) hard drive was still in the initial hard drive position in the computer. So I ended up with the OS on the SSD and the boot files on the old hard drive. I have done some research and decided fixing the issue at the moment is not worth the time or the potential trouble. I have also finished the Python technical document (its a tutorial really) which can be found [here](https://codepen.io/dirkles68/full/JjKRPwr).

The final project from the [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Responsive Web Design Certification was to create a personal portfolio page. I finished that as well. You can find that one [here](https://codepen.io/dirkles68/full/oNLOzaV). I actually had fun making this last one. It was very informative and helped me understand a little further how to use grids in CSS.

I have now moved on to JavaScript on freecodecamp. I will provide updates to that as needed.

Dirkles, out.
