Today was a little bit of nothing, and some important stuff mixed together. I did not get much accomplished, as I am still focused on getting this damn blog working the way I want it. I don't know html, or css, so I have just been scouring the web for help, and I came across this guide right [HERE](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). It was helpful for the most part, but also a little confusing. Earlier today I was able to figure out how to get my posts to show up on my main page, but not in their entirety, but as links. Following the guide listed above, I was able to create a site where the blogs are put on another page, as links. I don't know if I want it as links to each blog or as a feed.

I will mess around with that late. It is time to sleep.
