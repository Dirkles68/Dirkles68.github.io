Well it is official. I am a genius. I managed to fix my old laptop. No, not the old old Dell that I got working again with Linux, but the big one, with the failing hard drive. I have been googling "how to blah blah blah" for the last three or four days and really dreading all the work I was going to have to do to get this thing working, but it was actually quite easy. Let me break it down for you.

1. Computer was having issues with daily use, going really slow.
2. Started getting "hard drive failure" warnings every 20 minutes or so.
3. Ran anti-virus and anti-malware software to check for virus. Somehow this caused issues so I deleted the programs, which caused more issues.
4. Backed up important files, made image of current Win 8.1.
5. Ran Windows restore, which keeps files but wipes programs.
6. Restore did not improve performance or fix hard drive warnings.
7. Ran Windows factory , which reverted Windows back to ..... 8.
8. Nothing works in 8. Tried to upgrade to Windows 10 using the Microsoft Media Creation Tool.
9. MCT wont unpack Windows 10 onto "failing" hard drive.
10. Installed new 500gb SSD drive in the expansion slot of laptop.
11. Booted computer from thumb drive with MCT on it, installed Windows 10.
12. Computer works great now!

So that is it. I really thought it was going to be much more difficult. I am glad it is done. So now, I have a new desktop, and a refreshed laptop. Not bad.

### Any progress on the technical document website?

Not really, maybe a couple of lines here or there. I think I am going to starting buttoning it up. It is taking me way too long to complete it. I did run the tests to make sure it contains all necessary components, and it is good. I just need to find a stopping place, and finish it.
