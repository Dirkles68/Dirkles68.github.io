## DAY Three

I did not do much learning today, I really focused on compiling all the learning materials I have acquired. I need a place to put everything together. Hopefully some organization will be followed by inspiration and then I can really focus on each lesson. It might be best to pick one and just go to town on it.

That is it for now.
