It took me two hours, but I finished the first project under the [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) web design tutorials. I was confused at first, but I think I understand now how to get everything set up. I passed all the requirements, and the website ended up looking pretty decent for a quick job. [Here it is](https://codepen.io/dirkles68/full/GRZbpvR).

I think I am going to create a few more quick ones just to get the hang of it on my own, as I was peeking at the source code for their example a little more than I would like to admit. So tomorrow's goal is: create another tribute page from scratch, with limited help.

Dirkles, out.
