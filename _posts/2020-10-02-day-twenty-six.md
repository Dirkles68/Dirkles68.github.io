Ok, so maybe the reason I feel lost is not because I skipped a day, though I did not work on anything yesterday ('twas a Thursday). I think I am feeling lost because I am slowly realizing how much there is to learn. And I am just working on HTML/CSS. I have read in a few places that you should just get the basic syntax for HTML down and move on, but I feel like I will move on into something that will require a good understanding of something beyond the very basics of HTML and I will immediately be lost. I really don't know what to do at this point. I am still just practicing a few basic ideas, trying to drill into my brain how to get most things to work without googling things.

I think the next time I work on this stuff, I will move on to the next [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) tutorial project.

Dirkles, out.
