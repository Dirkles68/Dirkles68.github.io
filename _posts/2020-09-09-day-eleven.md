Nothing much to report tonight. I started hand writing things I learn or can remember from the __HTML/CSS__ tutorials. I am thinking that being able to write them out, without the assistance of an editor will help me retain the knowledge a little more. I also will just open up a notepad and knock out a few lines to keep things fresh. I didn't add anything new to my practice website today, as I was focused on starting the new tutorials.

Maybe tomorrow I will have something new and exciting for you.

Dirkles, out.
