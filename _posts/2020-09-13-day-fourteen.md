This weekend was a good balance of relaxing and learning. I got a lot done and still managed to spend a decent amount of time on Saturday and Sunday working on some <em style="color: #6633CC">HTML/CSS</em>. I am continuing to work on the [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) tutorials and they are going well.

#### Sidebar: Wow, I just ventured over to [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/) and I just lost 45 minutes.

Ok, I am back now to finish this blog post. Nothing new here, moving on. Tomorrow is a new day, back at work. Yay.

Dirkles, out.
