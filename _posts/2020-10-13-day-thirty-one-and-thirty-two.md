This is a special two-for one post. I finally finished the survey page, after many hours of messing with confusing CSS element positioning. It came out looking ok, and seems to function just fine. I should give it another go after I finish the projects so that I can really solidify the ideas before moving on. [HERE IS THE SURVEY PAGE](https://codepen.io/dirkles68/pen/KKMPymp).

I am starting to feel better about the HTML but the CSS is still very confusing. There seems to be an endless number of ways to do something and every resource I use to check says it slightly different. I am beginning to feel as if it is impossible to know it off the top of your head, and so the point is to understand how it could work and then just google it from there. It is slow going, but at least it gets done.

I started working on the next project, which is the "Product Landing Page". I have decided to create a page for a cowboy boot company, called Smith Boots. (Creative, I know.). This project seems to be a little bit easier, but then again, they all seem easy until you get a few minutes in to it, and you then realize you can't remember shit.

#### Side-note

I am combining last night's post with tonight because my computer was having issues. I am really starting to wonder how much life I have left in this laptop. I should start backing up important data onto a fresh hard drive, and possibly look at getting a new computer.

Dirkles, out.
