This weekend I took it a little easy on learning compared to last week. I did well all week so I decided to take Friday and Saturday night off. I did a little bit tonight, working on __HTML tables__ , but that is all. I did not progress at all on the CSS tutorial, which so far, I have been doing at an extremely slow pace.

SO for a Sunday, not too bad. Tomorrow, after the [Dallas Stars](https://www.nhl.com/stars) game, I will continue with the tutorial.

For now, my head hurts, and I know I am going to have a stressful day tomorrow (because of the rain), so I am going to bed.

Dirkles, out.
