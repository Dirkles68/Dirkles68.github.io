# No More Hockey for 2020!

Okay, so it is not anything to celebrate but the NHL season has finally come to an end. The Dallas Stars made it to the Stanley Cup finals, only to be defeated by the Tampa Bay Lightning in six games. This is the best the Stars have done in 20 years. While it was fun, it was also distracting. With that out of the way, it is time to focus more on learning.

# What's the plan?

The plan is the same. I will work on tutorials and then focus on related projects before moving on to the next tutorial. My goal for now is to complete the Responsive Wed Design training from [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design). I have already gone through two more modules tonight alone. That is pretty good progress considering how slow I have been going. I was spending a lot of time writing things down, but honestly, I think I need to stop doing that. I don't think it is helping. Coding, or practicing the concepts is what is going to help me learn.

# The weekend was a waste.

I did not do any learning last weekend. The boys were crazy and the house was a mess. Things needed to get done. I wish I could say that I did some relaxing, but other than hiking with the family, it was somewhat stressful as usual.
