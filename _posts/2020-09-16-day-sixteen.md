Like I stated in my post yesterday, I am having a hard time understanding positioning elements on a webpage. I spend most of tonight working on just the float element. Unless I am missing something, the tutorial I was doing just glossed over positioning, so I decided to crack open the __HTML for Dummies___ book I have. It is from 2008, but most of what I have read so far is still correct. Nothing much to report here, except that after an hour of working on the _float_ position, I am still a little confused. Hopefully it will click soon.

Dirkles, out.
