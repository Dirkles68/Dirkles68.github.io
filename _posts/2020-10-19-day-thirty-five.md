This one seems pretty simple. A straightforward technical doc, with very little CSS. I have chosen to write a technical doc on Python as a means to refresh my own (miniscule amount) of knowledge on the programming language. So in this case, I am killing two birds with one stone here. I have not completed much as of yet, I was really just getting started on it. More to come...

And before I go, is there a way to check how much data is stored in a Github repo?

Dirkles, out.
