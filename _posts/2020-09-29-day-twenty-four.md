# Done with HTML/CSS Tutorial!

I finally finished the last of the responsive web design tutorials from [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). Now that those are complete, it is time to work on the projects for these tutorials. I have quickly glanced over what is needed to be done, and I am already confused. But, I will continue working at it. Not now though. I am done for today.

Dirkles, out.
