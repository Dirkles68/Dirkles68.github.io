I finished another module today, one about making a website accessible to everyone, including those with a disability. It was pretty easy, and mostly talked about ways to organize your code so that a text reader can figure out the layout of the page. There was some other stuff, and I will probably go back over it just to make sure I fully understand the use of each lesson contained. I also started working on my own practice website, putting finishing touches on the navbar, re-organizing a little based on the lessons from today, and trying to polish things up and add new ideas. I think I am going to work on the page a another day or two before moving on to the next lesson.

I am tired.
Dirkles, out.
