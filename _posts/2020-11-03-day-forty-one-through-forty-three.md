Like I said in the previous post, it is becoming difficult to put a new post up every night. It might be because I have been working on the same HTML document for the last week or so. I should probably just button it up and get it submitted. I am definitely going way over the requirements, but I have been having some fun putting it together. It is also helping refresh my memory on many of the beginning parts of learning Python. So while it is taking a long time, I think that it is quietly beneficial.

I did get a new (refurbished) computer, and it is working great. I am still trying to rescue my laptop from doom, but I am having some issues. Maybe I will report on that whole situation at a later date.

Also, tonight is election night, so hopefully the country won't be on fire tomorrow.

Dirkles, out.
