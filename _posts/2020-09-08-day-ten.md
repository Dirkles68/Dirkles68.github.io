Once again, it is late and I am tired. I don't know if I did much today, but at least I am trying. I did not start any new lessons, but rather went back over the [Basic HTML and HTML5](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/) exercises and created my own website to test on. Its pretty easy, I just need to memorize some key things. But all of this got me thinking, and I have some questions...

## Questions

#### What editor should I use?
  -Python - Python IDE editor, Notepad++
  -HTML - Visual Studio Code
  -GitHub - Atom

Does it really matter though if I use one over the other. Perhaps I will make a blog post in a few weeks to discuss the pros/cons of each.

#### Am I going too slow?

There is no such thing as too slow, just too unmotivated, or too tired. Just remember, so is smooth, and smooth is fast.

#### Do I need to find more time to work on this?

I don't know how productive I can be right now with how tired I am at night. Perhaps I can start working a little on the weekends?

Ok, Dirkles out.
