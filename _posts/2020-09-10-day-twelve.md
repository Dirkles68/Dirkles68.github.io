### Am I doing this right?

I just don't know, but at this point I don't know if that really matters. Sure, I am going slow as hell, but at least I am doing it. I need to be methodical with this otherwise I will let it slide again, or I will move too quickly and find myself forgetting what I learned previously. There are many people out there with guides or a path of learning that one must follow strictly, and maybe once I am done with this HTML/CSS portion and head on over to Python, I will look for a more directed approach and stick to the roadmap.

For now though, I am going to continue to work through the HTML/CSS material, build a crappy website and see where it takes me.

Dirkles, out.
