Like the title says, I didn't get much done today. Work was brutal (it is Friday, so double the work) and I am tired. I worked a little bit on my practice website, created some gradients, practiced stripes and all that good stuff. But that is all I am going to do tonight. I need a break and maybe I will get some done tomorrow.

Dirkles, out.
