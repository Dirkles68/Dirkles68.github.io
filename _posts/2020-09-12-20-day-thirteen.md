## The rare Saturday learning session.

Today was a long day, coming after a long week, where work was more stressful than usual. I will admit, learning was tough this week. When I would get home from work, the last thing I would want to do is sit in front of the computer again. But, I managed to eek out an hour maybe an hour an a half of slow, tedious learning. Last weekend, I think I skipped Saturday, but did some learning on Friday and Sunday. I skipped Friday this week, and did about an hour tonight, after the <span style="color: green font_weight: bold;">Dallas Stars</span> won to go up 3-1 in the series against the Vegas Golden Knights.

Anyway, it was a good learning session, continuing with CSS selectors and colors and the whatnot.

Dirkles, out.
