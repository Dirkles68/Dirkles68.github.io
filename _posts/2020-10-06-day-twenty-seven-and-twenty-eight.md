Well now I have gone and done it. I forgot to make a post after working on something. It has all gone to shit now. How can I be trusted to learn all of this properly if I can't even follow a simple habit?

It is ok, it is not a big deal. I have been working on this stuff at night, after long days at work, when I probably should be relaxing. So it is bound to happen, that I forget to do something. I would rather it didn't as part of the whole exercise here is to create habits to hopefully lead to a better learning experience.

### So what have I been doing the last two days?

I started working on the next HTML/CSS project from [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). This is about building a survey form. It is pretty simple and over the last two days, I have put the framework up. The next step is to start working on the CSS, because right now, it looks like complete shit.

I am trying to do these projects without looking at other source code (mostly the example page that the website provides), but I am still looking at it a lot. I am finding that I am relying on it pretty heavily and it makes me nervous that it is not helping me figure it out and retain the information. I might have to make a few of these survey forms to make sure I understand it fully.

Dirkles, out.
