Tonight, I did start a new tutorial today. I just wanted to work some more on my practice website, just fart around, explore some of the ideas that I find interesting from the last lesson module. I did not get much done, but I did create this cool navigation bar design.

I am kind of proud of it. It only took me 2 hours to make. It should take me five minutes. I will get there eventually.

Dirkles, out.
