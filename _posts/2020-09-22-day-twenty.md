Tonight, I did not start a new tutorial. I just wanted to work some more on my practice website: just fart around, explore some of the ideas that I find interesting from the last lesson module. I did not get much done, but I did create this cool navigation bar design.

I am kind of proud of it. It only took me 2 hours to make. It should take me five minutes. I will get there eventually. And in my defense, I was exploring other options and cleaning up code, moving things to a CSS file at the same time. So not all 2 hours was spent on the navbar, just most of it. 

Dirkles, out.
