##Working with JSON

I have no idea what I am doing. I am just googling a lot. I was trying to figure something out for work where I can export messages for Slack into a file that I can open with Excel (or in my case, Google Sheets). I finally managed to get it to work, thanks to the wonderful website https://datatofish.com/json-string-to-csv-python/.

I still have no idea what I am doing, but at least I got what I wanted. Now I need to figure out a way to pull the data I need out of the messages.

What now?
