Wow. Ok, so six months have passed since I last posted anything. Not much has changed, except that for about 5 and 1/2 months, I have not been continuing with my education. I don't know what happened. I am going to blame COVID. It is still a thing, and though a lot of us are vaccinated, we still need to be careful. I started picking up Ruby since I found a resource that I am enjoying. I don't know if will amount to anything but I figured I would take it as far as I can. From what I can tell, learining any language will be useful because it is the programming part that is important to learn. Ruby to Python or Java should not be too hard once I am able to start working on projects. Or at least I think it wont be too hard. I am trying to stay positive here. 

I am going to stick with this Ruby program for a bit. Then maybe head over to Odin Project for Javascript, I don't really have a plan.

Oh and the current resource I am using is [App Academy](https://open.appacademy.io/) (the free one!)

Dirkles out.
