I finally finished the Applied Visual Design portion of the CSS tutorial. It took a week, mostly because I kept getting sidetracked, practicing different ways to do something or trying to figure out exactly what was going on with the positioning of elements. I think before I move on to the next module, I need to apply some of the concepts into the practice website. There were some good ideas like:
 - animating the color change of a button
 - ::before/::after
 - different transform functions (scale, skew, etc)
 - @keyframes to create movement

 This is just to name a few. I think I will spend a few days going back over them to find really get a grasp on them.

 Dirkles, out.
