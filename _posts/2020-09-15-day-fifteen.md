Last night, I wasn't feeling so great, so I took some medicine and went to bed early (for me anyways). This meant that I did not get any learning done. But that is okay. It is good to take some time off sometimes.

So tonight, I got back on it, and completed a few lessons on CSS, still from freecodecamp, and I got a little stuck on positioning. Margins, positions (absolute, relative, fixed), float, etc.. I am going to need to spend some more time experimenting with all of this before I feel comfortable moving on. This is where you can easily be derailed. If you don't have a firm grasp on something basic, it will be hard to get a firm grasp on the more complicated elements that are based on the simple concepts. I think tomorrow I will continue to practice the different positioning options and how they all relate to each other.

Dirkles, out.
