### Ok folks! It is finally starting to work

Today I was able to get a little bit more content onto the site, with a lot of help from a new tutorial i found [here](https://biodata-club.github.io/githubPagesTutorial/#fork-the-repository-from-github). It has given me the framework to put stuff up reliably on the website, and i will continue to add daily blogs here, but also mess around with the frameork a little, and see if eventually I can piece it together on my own from scratch.

Funny side note here, I managed to stumble upon the website my group at Texas State created for our Hill Country Alliance project. Enjoy it [here!](http://sites.geo.txstate.edu/g4427/F07/g4427f07-03/index.html)

I am tired, today was a long day and I have been sitting in front of a screen all day. Time to read 2 pages from my book and fall asleep.

Dirkles, out.
